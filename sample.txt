This is a sample text file for testing the token estimator.
The token estimator calculates the number of tokens based on character count.
It assumes that 1 token equals 4 characters.

You can use this file to test the basic functionality of the estimator.
Try creating larger files to test the warning message for files exceeding 4000 characters!
